# OpenReliefKit
A curated, open-source collection of battle-tested code snippets, datasets, and low-cost hardware plans that empower communities and NGOs to spin up rapid-response tools—like offline communication hubs, crisis-mapping dashboards, and resource-tracking apps—within hours of a natural disaster.
